An extension to Raphael elements to make them draggable.
Just call some_raphael_object.draggable() and you're done.
Or pass options and/or add methods to customise the behaviour.

Options:
  drag_obj
     Start the drag on this object instead of "this".
  right_button
     leave undefined to drag using either button, otherwise set to
     false or true for left or right button only.
  reluctance
     Number of pixels of motion before a drag starts (default 3).

Optional methods on drag_obj:

 dragUpdate(dragging_over, delta_x, delta_y, event)
     replaces the default one (which uses Raphael's translate())

 dragStart(x, y, event)
     called (after reluctance) with the mousedown event and location.

 dragFinish(dropped_on, x, y, event)
     called with the mouseup event and location (if not cancelled).

 dragCancel()
     called if the drag is cancelled (after dragUpdate has reverted the motion)

The escape key can be used to cancel a drag and revert the motion.

Simple example:

      paper = Raphael($("notepad"), 200, 200);
      rect = paper.rect(5, 10, 60, 20, 10).attr({stroke: "#009", "stroke-width": 3});
      rect.draggable();

If the object supports an dragUpdate method, that will be called with the
x and y deltas and the event for each mouse move while dragging.

Example (resize the rectangle instead of dragging it):

      paper = Raphael($("notepad"), 200, 200);
      rect = paper.rect(5, 10, 60, 20, 10).attr({stroke: "#009", "stroke-width": 3});
      rect.draggable({reluctance: 10});

      rect.updateDrag = function(dx, dy, event) {
        rect.attr({
          width: rect.attrs.width + dx,
          height: rect.attrs.height + dy
        })
      }
